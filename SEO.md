### 6. PERFORMANCE & CORE WEB VITALS ISSUES

#### Critical Performance Problems:
- ‚ùå **LCP (Largest Contentful Paint)**: Likely >2.5s due to unoptimized images
- ‚ùå **FID (First Input Delay)**: No measurement/optimization in place
- ‚ùå **CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift)**: No layout shift prevention
- ‚ùå **Image optimization disabled**: `unoptimized: true` in config
- ‚ùå **No compression enabled**: Missing gzip/brotli
- ‚ùå **No prefetching strategy**: Missing resource hints
- ‚ùå **No critical CSS inlining**: Affects above-the-fold rendering

#### Required Performance Optimizations:

**1. Image Optimization Strategy:**
```typescript
// components/optimized-image.tsx
import Image from 'next/image'

export function OptimizedImage({ src, alt, ...props }) {
  return (
    <Image
      src={src}
      alt={alt}
      loading="lazy"
      placeholder="blur"
      blurDataURL="data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j/4AAQSkZJRgABAQAAAQ..."
      quality={85}
      {...props}
    />
  )
}
```

**2. Core Web Vitals Monitoring:**
```typescript
// lib/web-vitals.ts
import { getCLS, getFID, getFCP, getLCP, getTTFB } from 'web-vitals'

export function sendToAnalytics(metric) {
  gtag('event', metric.name, {
    event_category: 'Web Vitals',
    value: Math.round(metric.name === 'CLS' ? metric.value * 1000 : metric.value),
    event_label: metric.id,
    non_interaction: true,
  })
}

getCLS(sendToAnalytics)
getFID(sendToAnalytics)
getFCP(sendToAnalytics)
getLCP(sendToAnalytics)
getTTFB(sendToAnalytics)
```

**3. Critical CSS Inlining:**
```css
/* Critical CSS for above-the-fold content */
.hero-section {
  /* Inline critical styles */
}
```

### 7. MISSING ANALYTICS & TRACKING SETUP

#### Required Tracking Implementation:

**1. Google Analytics 4:**
```typescript
// lib/gtag.ts
declare global {
  interface Window {
    gtag: any;
  }
}

export const GA_TRACKING_ID = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_ID

export const pageview = (url: string) => {
  window.gtag('config', GA_TRACKING_ID, {
    page_path: url,
  })
}

export const event = ({ action, category, label, value }: {
  action: string
  category: string
  label?: string
  value?: number
}) => {
  window.gtag('event', action, {
    event_category: category,
    event_label: label,
    value: value,
  })
}
```

**2. Conversion Tracking Events:**
```typescript
// Track appointment bookings
event({
  action: 'appointment_booking',
  category: 'conversion',
  label: 'contact_form',
  value: 1
})

// Track phone calls
event({
  action: 'phone_call',
  category: 'conversion', 
  label: 'header_phone',
  value: 1
})

// Track service page visits
event({
  action: 'service_page_view',
  category: 'engagement',
  label: service_name,
  value: 1
})
```

### 8. LOCAL SEO OPTIMIZATION

#### Google Business Profile Integration:
```json
