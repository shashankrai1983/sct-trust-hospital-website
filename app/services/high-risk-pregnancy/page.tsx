      question: "What exactly is a high-risk pregnancy?",
      answer: "A high-risk pregnancy is one where the mother or baby has an increased chance of health problems during pregnancy, labor, or delivery. The term 'high-risk' doesn't mean something will definitely go wrong, but rather indicates that closer monitoring and specialized care are needed to ensure the best outcomes for both mother and baby.",
