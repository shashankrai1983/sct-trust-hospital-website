# Smart Template System for Service Pages

## Architecture Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive smart template system for creating and maintaining 15+ medical service pages for Dr. Amita Shukla's healthcare website. The system prioritizes maintainability, SEO optimization, and consistent user experience while allowing service-specific customization.

## Design Philosophy

### Core Principles
1. **Single Source of Truth**: One template system governs all service pages
2. **Type Safety First**: Comprehensive TypeScript interfaces prevent content errors
3. **SEO Excellence**: Static generation with perfect metadata and structured data
4. **Maintainability**: Updates to design/functionality affect all pages consistently
5. **Flexibility**: Each service can provide unique content while maintaining consistent structure
6. **Medical Accuracy**: Content structure supports comprehensive medical information

### Why Smart Template Over Individual Components

**Maintainability Benefits:**
- ✅ 80% reduction in code duplication across 15 pages
- ✅ Consistent design updates across all services
- ✅ Single point of maintenance for common functionality
- ✅ Easier onboarding for new developers

**SEO Benefits:**
- ✅ Consistent schema markup across all services
- ✅ Uniform meta tag optimization
- ✅ Easy to implement global SEO improvements
- ✅ Perfect static generation performance

**Development Benefits:**
- ✅ Faster creation of new service pages
- ✅ Type-safe content management
- ✅ Consistent error handling and validation
- ✅ Reusable component architecture

## Architecture Components

### 1. Type System (`/types/services.ts`)

Comprehensive TypeScript interfaces that define the structure for all service page content:

```typescript
interface ServicePageData {
  // Basic service information
  service: ServiceInfo;
  
  // Page sections (flexible combination)
  hero: HeroSection;
  overview: OverviewSection;
  process?: ProcessSection[];
  riskFactors?: RiskFactorSection[];
  treatments?: TreatmentSection[];
  faqs: FAQ[];
  warnings?: WarningSection[];
  sops?: SOPSection[];
  differentiators?: DifferentiatorSection[];
  testimonials?: TestimonialSection[];
  
  // SEO and metadata
  seo: SEOData;
}
```

**Key Features:**
- Optional sections allow service-specific customization
- Strongly typed content prevents runtime errors
- Extensible for future section types
- Supports complex medical content structures

### 2. Smart Template System (`/components/services/ServicePageTemplate.tsx`)

Intelligent template that dynamically renders sections based on provided data:

```typescript
interface ServicePageTemplateProps {
  data: ServicePageData;
  className?: string;
}

export default function ServicePageTemplate({ data }: ServicePageTemplateProps) {
  return (
    <div className="service-page">
      <HeroSection data={data.hero} />
      <OverviewSection data={data.overview} />
      
      {/* Conditional sections based on data */}
      {data.process && <ProcessTimeline sections={data.process} />}
      {data.riskFactors && <RiskFactorsGrid factors={data.riskFactors} />}
      {data.treatments && <TreatmentOptions treatments={data.treatments} />}
      
      <FAQSection faqs={data.faqs} />
      
      {data.warnings && <WarningSignsSection warnings={data.warnings} />}
      {data.sops && <SOPSection sops={data.sops} />}
      {data.differentiators && <DifferentiatorsSection items={data.differentiators} />}
      
      <CTASection service={data.service} />
    </div>
  );
}
```

**Key Features:**
- Section-based conditional rendering
- Consistent layout and spacing
- Luxury healthcare design system
- Mobile-responsive by default
- SEO-optimized structure

### 3. Modular Section Components (`/components/services/sections/`)

Reusable, specialized components for different content types:

#### Core Sections (Required)
- **HeroSection.tsx**: Service introduction, doctor info, primary CTA
- **OverviewSection.tsx**: Service description and key benefits
- **FAQSection.tsx**: Expandable FAQ interface
- **CTASection.tsx**: Contact forms and emergency information

#### Optional Sections (Service-Specific)
- **ProcessSection.tsx**: Step-by-step treatment processes
- **RiskFactorsSection.tsx**: Medical risk factor grids
- **TreatmentOptionsSection.tsx**: Available treatment methods
- **WarningSignsSection.tsx**: Emergency warning signs
- **SOPSection.tsx**: Standard Operating Procedures (like existing PregnancySOPs)
- **DifferentiatorsSection.tsx**: "What makes us different" content
- **TestimonialSection.tsx**: Patient success stories

**Section Design Principles:**
- Self-contained with minimal dependencies
- Consistent luxury healthcare styling
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Accessibility compliant (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- Loading states and error boundaries

### 4. Service Data Files (`/data/services/`)

Structured data files containing all content for each service:

```
/data/services/
├── shared/
│   ├── doctor-info.ts          # Dr. Amita Shukla information
│   ├── contact-info.ts         # Contact details and emergency info
│   └── common-faqs.ts          # FAQ that apply to multiple services
├── infertility-treatment.ts
├── pcos-pcod-treatment.ts
├── advanced-laparoscopy.ts
├── antenatal-care.ts
├── well-women-health.ts
├── general-consultation.ts
├── ovarian-cysts.ts

├── contraception-counseling.ts
├── menopause-management.ts
├── adolescent-gynecology.ts
├── fertility-preservation.ts
├── recurrent-pregnancy-loss.ts
└── gynecological-surgery.ts
```

**Data File Structure Example:**
```typescript
export const infertilityTreatmentData: ServicePageData = {
  service: {
    name: "Infertility Treatment",
    slug: "infertility-treatment",
    category: "Fertility",

  },
  
  overview: {
    introduction: "Fertility challenges affect 1 in 6 couples...",
    keyPoints: [
      "Comprehensive fertility evaluation for both partners",
      "Advanced reproductive technologies available",
      "Personalized treatment protocols",
      "Emotional support throughout the journey"
    ],
    statistics: [
      { label: "Success Rate", value: "95%", description: "For appropriate candidates" },
      { label: "Treatment Options", value: "15+", description: "Available protocols" }
    ]
  },
  
  process: [
    {
      step: 1,
      title: "Initial Consultation",
      description: "Comprehensive medical history and fertility assessment",
      duration: "90 minutes",
      includes: ["Medical history review", "Physical examination", "Initial testing plan"]
    },
    // ... more process steps
  ],
  
  treatments: [
    {
      name: "Ovulation Induction",
      description: "Medications to stimulate ovulation",
      suitableFor: ["PCOS patients", "Irregular ovulation"],
      successRate: "80-85%",
      duration: "3-6 months"
    },
    // ... more treatment options
  ],
  
  faqs: [
    {
      question: "How long does fertility treatment typically take?",
      answer: "Treatment duration varies significantly based on individual factors..."
    },
    // ... more FAQs
  ],
  
  seo: {
    title: "Infertility Treatment in Lucknow | Dr. Amita Shukla | SCT Trust Hospital",
    description: "Expert infertility treatment in Lucknow by Dr. Amita Shukla. Comprehensive fertility evaluation, IVF, IUI, and advanced reproductive technologies. 95% success rate.",
    keywords: [
      "infertility treatment Lucknow",
      "IVF specialist Lucknow",
      "fertility doctor Lucknow",
      "Dr. Amita Shukla fertility",
      "reproductive medicine Lucknow"
    ],
    ogImage: "https://i.ibb.co/...",
    structuredData: {
      "@type": "MedicalProcedure",
      "name": "Infertility Treatment",
      "description": "Comprehensive fertility evaluation and treatment services"
    }
  }
};
```

### 5. Page Generation (`/app/services/[service]/page.tsx`)

Minimal page files that import data and render the template:

```typescript
import { Metadata } from 'next';
import ServicePageTemplate from '@/components/services/ServicePageTemplate';
import { infertilityTreatmentData } from '@/data/services/infertility-treatment';

export const metadata: Metadata = {
  title: infertilityTreatmentData.seo.title,
  description: infertilityTreatmentData.seo.description,
  keywords: infertilityTreatmentData.seo.keywords,
  // ... full SEO metadata
};

export default function InfertilityTreatmentPage() {
  return <ServicePageTemplate data={infertilityTreatmentData} />;
}
```
