# Security Guidelines - SCT Trust Hospital Website

## üîê Security Implementation Overview

This document outlines the security measures implemented for the SCT Trust Hospital website to ensure HIPAA compliance and protect sensitive healthcare information.

## üõ°Ô∏è Authentication & Authorization

### Admin Authentication
- **Framework**: NextAuth.js with credentials provider
- **Password Hashing**: bcrypt with salt rounds = 12
- **Session Management**: JWT-based sessions
- **Environment Variables**: All credentials stored securely in environment variables

### Security Best Practices
- Passwords must be minimum 8 characters
- Admin credentials never hardcoded in source code
- Test credentials separated from production
- Regular password rotation recommended

## üîí Security Headers Implementation

### HIPAA-Compliant Headers
- **Content Security Policy (CSP)**: Prevents XSS attacks
- **Strict Transport Security (HSTS)**: Enforces HTTPS
- **X-Frame-Options**: Prevents clickjacking
- **X-Content-Type-Options**: Prevents MIME sniffing
- **Cross-Origin Policies**: Restricts cross-origin access

### API Route Protection
- Enhanced security headers for `/api/*` routes
- No-cache policies for sensitive data
- CORS restrictions for healthcare compliance

## üîê Environment Variables Security

### Required Variables
```env
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=          # 32+ character random string
ADMIN_EMAIL=              # Admin login email
ADMIN_PASSWORD_HASH=      # bcrypt hash of admin password
MONGODB_URI=              # Database connection string
MONGODB_DB=               # Database name
NEXT_PUBLIC_RECAPTCHA_SITE_KEY=    # reCAPTCHA public key
RECAPTCHA_SECRET_KEY=              # reCAPTCHA private key
```

### Security Guidelines
- Never commit real credentials to version control
- Use different credentials for development/staging/production
- Rotate keys regularly (monthly recommended)
- Use secure random generators for secrets

## üö® Security Incidents Response

### Immediate Actions
1. Change all credentials immediately
2. Review access logs for unauthorized activity
3. Notify affected users if data breach suspected
4. Document incident for compliance review

### Prevention Measures
- Regular security audits
- Dependency vulnerability scanning
- Access log monitoring
- Environment variable rotation
